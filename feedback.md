- Delete old branches after merging PRs
- Great issues (well documented)
- Maybe more issues (in general there should be 1 or more issues per PR)
- For removing stuff you want ignored (e.g. .DS_Store)
  - status should be empty
  - git rm -rf --cached .
  - git add .
  - git commit -m "cleanup"
- Digging the trend towards consistent commit messages
- Put some stuff in README
- Consider making an .eslintrc file
- Consider utility function instead of repeated/copied code in api (if it remains so similar)
- Consider squashing together synopsisParse and synopsis in reducer / redux store
